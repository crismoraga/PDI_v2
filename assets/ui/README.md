Assets for UI enhancements and animations.

- If you have a small celebration GIF you can add it here as `celebration.gif` and the app will show it when a new species is found.
- Recommended size: around 300x300 px and under 500KB.

Tip: you can add other asset images and access them via `pkg_resources` or `Path` from the app.
